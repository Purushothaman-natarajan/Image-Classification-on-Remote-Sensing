Both these explainers are post-hoc in nature, so they explain the predictions from model using the input and the output, hence it does not demand the training dataset.\n","\n","LIME: It perturbs the input and fits it in a linear model to verify whether the selected feature is contributing for the prediction or not.\n","\n","GradCAMM: It uses class activation maps, where in the gradients with high score is visualized; this method suitable for model based on CNN networks.\n","\n","Atlast, we also integrate the model and the explainer on a interface (Using Gradio) through which the user can upload a image and get its class label along with its explantion."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":166505,"status":"ok","timestamp":1714050666142,"user":{"displayName":"Purushothaman
